High Availablity of NameNode:
Gadoop cluster has two nodes:
Name Node and Secondary Node
Nmaenode stays in the active state and the secondary node stays in the standby node.
The active node is responsible for servicing the client requests and also for storing metadata.
Secondary namenode stays in the backup for in case of failover for recovery.
For synchronizing the active node with the active node,current implementation requires that the two nodes
both have the access to the directory on a shared storage device.
When any modification of namespace is done,the active namenode logs the activity into edit log file stored in shared directory.
The secondary namenode keeps a track of the edit logs and as soon as it finds that the edit logs file has been updated,it also updates same changes in its own namespace.
In the event of failover,the standby will ensure that it has read all of its edits from shared storage before promoting into the active state.
This ensures that the name state is fully synchronized before a failover occurs
